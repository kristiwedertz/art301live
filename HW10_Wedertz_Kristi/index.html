          <h1 class="yellow-back">Who Are We?</h1>
          <p>We are animal lovers.<br><br>In 2012, only 57.7 percent of cats and dogs were making it out of the city shelters alive, with 18,000 cats and dogs killed. In 2016, the number was reduced to 3,236 for an 82 percent reduction in killings in just five years. 2017 statistics from Los Angeles are also encouraging for NKLA, showing a 90.4% save rate in January. Read our news release here.<br><br>Our plan is straightforward: provide spay/neuter services where they are needed most so that fewer animals go into shelters, and increase adoptions so that more animals are placed into new homes. Step by critical step, we believe that together, we can bring the number of pets killed in Los Angeles shelters to zero.

          <h1 class="yellow-back">Why Adopt?</h1>
          <p>Animal shelters and rescue groups are brimming with happy, healthy pets just waiting for someone to take them home. Most shelter pets wound up there because of a human problem like a move or a divorce, not because the animals did anything wrong. Many are already housetrained and used to living with families.<br><br>Usually when you adopt a pet, the cost of spay/neuter, first vaccinations (and sometimes even microchipping!) is included in the adoption price, which can save you some of the up front costs of adding a new member to your family. Depending on the animal, you may also save on housebreaking and training expenses.<br><br>No one needs to see another selfie—unless it’s a selfie of you with the adorable pet you just adopted! Adopt a pet, post those pictures and let the well-earned likes roll in.
